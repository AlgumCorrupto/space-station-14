Mining is an activity that comes with many dangers. Without regard to your safety or the safety of others, loss of life may occur.

Fortunately there are a few simple measures that can be undertaken to ensure that you and those around you will remain uninjured and alive.

# Cave-Ins
There is rock in the ceiling above you, and gravity wants to bring it down. To avoid being buried alive, you must ensure that the ceiling is adequately supported by rocks, walls, or girders.

Supports can only support ceiling [color=yellow]2 tiles[/color] away. This means that a tunnel more than 5 tiles wide will cave in.

## If You Are Caved In...
- Radio for help.
- Put on a hardsuit, put on a mask and turn on your air supply.
- You may be able to dig yourself out. Be careful not to cause another cave-in.

#General safety tips

Cave-ins present a tricky yet common challenge to contend with, but other dangers are present within the mine that a few simple precautions can mitigate.

These simple hints will help you through:

1) Always carry a pickaxe or a drill. You may not be mining at the time, but keeping one of these on your in case someone else causes a cave-in will mean you can dig yourself out and not rely on outside help.

2) Ensure internals are active when you are in the mine. While not ideal to waste air if it is present in the mine at the time, the mine may be subject to sudden gas leaks. If your internals are not active you may find yourself suddenly huffing plasma gas. 9/10 doctors do not recommend this.

3) Respect the airlock! Less for your safety and more for the service workers on board the station, always always always make sure the airlock doors are closed on one side. If you feel like you or another crewmember may fumble this simple procedure, consider builing firelocks at the station-side airlock.

4) Be wary of sudden spacings if mining outwards. While quite hilarious to suddenly be hurled in to the black abyss of space, its also quite dangerous and can be difficult to remedy. If you think you may be about to breach the exterior of the asteroid, or you hear meteors, either find some magboots or position yourself behind another wall.

5) Always wear a hardsuit when you are in the mine. At any time the ceiling may come down on you, high pressure gas may flood the mine, or you may be exposed to the vaccuum of space. Without a hardsuit, you will die.
